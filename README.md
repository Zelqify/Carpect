  6. Now you'll see a text that says to configure the tweenable properties.

  7. Configure your object at your own discretion. Make sure that you only change properties that can be tweened.
  You also don't need to create a backup for your object. It'll get to it's own old status after you clicking next.

  8. After that, you will see a text that says "Set the tween length (In seconds)"
  Basically write down the animation duration there.

  9. After you've done these steps, click to complete button and you'll see a code.
  Copy that code and paste it where ever you want.

** If something doesn't works, you probably did something wrong or did configure unsupported properties.
